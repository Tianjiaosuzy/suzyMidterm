# Conlang.com
# Topic
 Conlang.com is a website targeting on helping language learners to apply the language the learn in the real life context. Conlang.com is a website combing language learning and social media interactions together. In Conlang, users are able to use their newly-learnt words and expressions to write their blogs. And since everyone in the platform is language learner, this nature provides a safe zone to make mistakes and learn from others.
# Problem
 Learning language is not only about remembering vocabulary, grammars and expressions; instead, it relates more with putting the language into the context. Thus, understanding the context and actually using it are the keys in learning a new language. However, language learners may not always keep these two points in mind.
# Target Audience
 Whoever interested in learning a language and eager to use the language, see the achievement, and share with others.
# User Story
 Already included in the website (in the homepage).
# Strategy
1. Site Objectives:
 - The objectives of learning: 1. SWBAT start a conversation in various topics; 2. SWBAT write down what they learn in their blogs; 3. SWBAT proactively talk with users from other countries in the language they learnt
 - The goals of learning: By learning and practicing in real life blogging, users are expected to master the language the learnt, including vocabulary, grammar and the correct use in certain context. The ultimate goal of the site is to become a large social networking site based on language learning. After learning enough of the new language, users share whatever stories they want in the platform and make friends with those speak the targeting language or studying the same language at the same time.
2. Success Metrics
 - Things to asses: 1. Vocabulary and expressions attained; 2. Application in blogging; 3. Changes in attitudes towards learning and using a new language; 4. Actual behavior changes towards learning and using a new language;
 - Pre-assessment: Before each lesson starts, users will be presented a quiz page containing several multiple choice questions. If the final result scores over 75%, he will be able to proceed to learn the new lesson, otherwise, he need to go back and watch a short video summary/ chart summary about the knowledge embedded in these questions (which are mainly learnt from previous lesson).
 - Summative assessment: After each lesson, users will be presented a quiz containing several multiple choice questions. With each question they get wrong, there is a quick review and explanation of that language point, as well as the exact time when this point is mentioned in the video.
 - Formative assessment: After each unit, users will be asked rate their own learning feelings and outcomes, and finish a test including every key point they learnt. Given the result, ideally, the back-end system can give some personal feedback and suggestions, and make adaptive changes on the following learning process. (eg. If the user is not good at pronunciation part, the following learning will still include the pronunciation part, which will be skipped in regular mode.)
# Scope

  In the pre-assessment page, it will direct users to start learning from the videos which correspond with their existing language levels;
  In the learning pages, all the lessons in the current unit will be listed, and after the video, the post-assessment presented will direct the users to next lessons if they meet required scores;
  In the blog pages, with the tags, users are able to choose to follow or chat with each other.
2. Content specifications:
  In the homepage, it mainly presents the most important features of our website and the sample blogs of users;
  In the pre-assessment page, it will present several multiple choices;
  In the learning pages, it covers lesson videos, summaries and pro-lesson-quiz, and also a text area to take notes.
